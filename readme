Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

Awesome!!!


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

This assignment made me a far more competent ARM64 developer. However,
adopting this new mindset and using hardware tricks was very difficult
and debugging bigintaddoptopt was a bit of a nightmare, to say the least.



------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?
No bugs. I worked painstakingly to make sure that was the case.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is your mywc program test plan?

Boundary Tests:

mywcempty.txt - This file contains nothing, testing the boundary of 
there being an empty file, hence returning 0 lines, 0 words, and 0 
characters

mywcspace.txt - This file contains one space, testing the boundary of 
there being just one space character, hence returning 0 lines, 0 words,
but 1 character (space)

mywconeletter.txt - This file contains one letter (we used the letter q),
testing the boundary of a text file consisting of a single letter, hence 
returning 0 lines, 1 word (the letter), and 1 character (the letter)

mywcnewline.txt - This file contains one new line (made by pressing enter),
testing the boundary of a text file consisting of one new line character,
hence returning 1 line, 0 words, and 1 character (new line)


Statement Tests:
/* has to execute every line of code in mywc.c */ 

mywcstatement.txt - Using a bit of the script from the First Harry Potter
movie, we created a text file that was able to hit everyline of code, making
sure to not end with a space character as to allow the line 'if (iInWord)'
and its contents (lWordCount+++) to be accessed. 



Stress Tests:
/* 50,000 characters, 1000s, randomly generated, contains every
legal character */

mywcallcharacters.txt - This file contains 1000 lines, 1981 words, and 49909
characters, designed to test the stress of the programs by maximizing the
inputs (no more than 1000 lines and 50000 words).
